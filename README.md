# Dockwatch

## Purpose

Simple UI driven way to manage updates & notifications for Docker containers.

## Wiki

We used to keep most of the information here but it was not organized or pleasant having to do so much scrolling. Instead, there is a wiki available that explains everything in detail. If you need further assistance there is a Support link on the main page of the wiki to get you into the right Discord server for help.
